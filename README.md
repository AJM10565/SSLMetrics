## About
This repository holds my most up to date code on the Loyola University Chicago SSLMetrics project.

This code is meant to perform testing on a GitHub repository to determine a series of metrics useful for developers and end users. 

The current state of this code only performs the backend data collection of the project. This will be updated when metrics are implemented.

---
## Use Case
These project is meant to determine a series of developer focused metrics that surround the meta of the code. In other words, this project is not concerned with how fast the code runs (although that could be/ is a component), but rather how the code is written.
