Fixes a bug where we miscomputed progress when the set of terms provided by
populate_initial_workspace changed between chunks.

The algorithm for accumulating progress is now as follows:

1. For each chunk, compute the percentage of the pipeline execution that the
   chunk will account for (we already did this to determine how to weight the
   contribution of each term).

2. Within each chunk, divide the total percentage to be completed by the number
   of terms that will actually be loaded or computed. This required two
   upstream refactors:
   1. We now compute ``execution_order`` earlier and pass it to
      ``compute_chunk``.
   2. We now filter out pre-populated terms from ``execution_order``.

3. For each term we load or compute, increment the total progress percentage by
   the value computed in (2).

The end result of this is that, at the end of each chunk, we should progress to
the percentage that corresponds to the chunk end's location in the overall
pipeline execution. Within each chunk, we should progress by a uniform amount
with each term. That uniform amount may vary from chunk to chunk however, if we
compute different numbers of terms in each chunk.",0

This change enables us to define ""abstract"" subclasses of DataSetFamily
which implement some set of attributes, but don't represent tangible
families of DataSets, and thus don't have meaningful values for
`extra_dims`.

Previously, all subclasses of DataSetFamily had to define non-empty
`extra_dims`. Subclasses were detected in DataSetFamilyMeta by checking
if the base classes of the class under construction were specified as
anything other than the designated sentinel value: if so, `extra_dims`
was transformed to an OrderedDict and checked for non-emptiness.

With this change, the metaclass instead checks for an `__abstract__`
attribute of the class under construction: if it is found and set to a
truthy value, `extra_dims` (and `_SliceType`) is left unchecked and
unmodified. Regardless of its value, the `__abstract__` attribute is
removed from the constructed class' body: each subclass which wishes to
remain abstract must specify this attribute again.",0

Previously, for a large diff, I was getting output that looked like:

```
AssertionError: extra key in result: set([u'timestamp'])
keys do not match
path: _[u'CA'][u'table_1'][u'base'][u'indices'].viewkeys()
result is missing key: set([u'indices'])
keys do not match
path: _[u'CA'][u'table_2'][u'checkpoints'].viewkeys()
extra key in result: set([u'timestamp'])
keys do not match
path: _[u'CA'][u'table_3'][u'base'][u'indices'].viewkeys()
result is missing key: set([u'indices'])
keys do not match
```

This is hard to parse when there's a lot of it, because it's hard to see which
lines should be grouped together.

The same output now looks like:

```
AssertionError: keys do not match
extra key in result: set([u'timestamp'])
path: _[u'CA'][u'table_1'][u'base'][u'indices'].viewkeys()
===
keys do not match

===

The `week_start` date rule was incorrectly returning `False` for
`2018-12-31` on `NYSE` calendar.

The root cause of the bug was that the groupby used in
`TradingDayOfWeekRule.execution_period_values` was using the pairing
of `year` and `weekofyear`. This pairing grouped `2018-12-31` with
the first week of January 2018 (`2018-01-02`, `2018-01-03`, ...),
instead of with `2019-01-02`, `2019-01-03`, ...

This misgrouping occurred because the values of (year, weekofyear)
for `2018-12-31` are (2018, 1); however the other dates that are in the
same week as `2018-12-31` have a value of (2019, 1).

Since `2018-12-31` was misgrouped, the call to `nth(0)` would not select
it as the first of the week; since it appeared to be the last day of the
first week of `2018`

Instead, use the `isocalendar` method of the datetime object.
https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isocalendar
`2018-12-31` is part of the ISO Week `2019-W01-1`, as are `2019-01-02`, etc.
(ISO Weeks location is determined by where the Thursday falls.)

Also, change the edge case tests so that a truth table of date and
expected 'should trigger' result is defined.

In the previous version of the test, moving the start date before
the New Year was hitting edge cases within the test construction around
offsets and calendar days.
Moving the first ""sim date"" would have been required to make sure that

When resolving data points to an output row index, we do not include records
with a timestamp of _exactly_ the data query cutoff time:

https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/5cda2ad542cb1eab02a84a6685dfb3d2adabd44e/zipline/pipeline/loaders/blaze/_core.pyx#L566-L572

however, when deciding which checkpoint to retrieve we would select anything
less than *or equal to* the query start timestamp, after it had been adjusted to
the data query cutoff time:

https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/5cda2ad542cb1eab02a84a6685dfb3d2adabd44e/zipline/pipeline/loaders/blaze/core.py#L1043-L1047

If we had a checkpoint at exactly the data query time, we would have selected it
meaning all of the data would have a timestamp of exactly the data query
time. We only select base rows between the checkpoint timestamp and the upper
dt, so we would not have any base rows between the checkpoint and the first
output index. When we go to slot these checkpoint rows into the output rows, we
would shift them all forward one day leaving us with a leading missing row
instead of the checkpoint data.

This change makes us select the most recent checkpoint strictly less than the
lower_dt which correctly gives us the checkpoint data on the first row of the
output when the query begins on a checkpoint boundary.",0

Fixes a bug where _select_most_recent_symbols_chunk assumed that non-aggregated
columns in a GROUP BY expression would resolve to the first record in the
group.

Previously we rendered a select like this:

```
SELECT sid, symbol, company_symbol, share_class_symbol FROM (
    SELECT sid, symbol, company_symbol, share_class_symbol
    FROM equity_symbol_mappings
    WHERE sid IN (<list of sids>)
    ORDER_BY end_date ASCENDING
)
GROUP BY sid
```

It appears that on older versions of SQLite, this reliably gave the last symbol
for all symbol mappings associated with ``sid``, but on newer versions (or at
the very least, in whatever configuration Travis is currently using), it's no
longer the case.

As of this change we now render the following query instead:

```
SELECT sid, symbol, company_symbol, share_class_symbol, max(end_date)
FROM equity_symbol_mappings
WHERE sid IN (<list of sids>)
GROUP BY sid
```

This uses the fact that SQLite treats the max() and min() aggregation functions
specially for aggregation functions:

> When the min() or max() aggregate functions are used in an aggregate query,
> all bare columns in the result set take values from the input row which also
> contains the minimum or maximum. Only the built-in min() and max() functions
> work this way.",0

Pandas raises a warning here because we're assigning to a column of a
subset of a dataframe. This warning is intended to prevent people from
doing things like::

    df[df.col1 > 10]['col1'] = <value>

which has no effect because the first [] creates a copy, which then gets
mutated, so the original frame remains unchanged.

In this case, however, we've bound the copy to a name that we're going to
continue to use, so we don't care about the warning.",0

This commit adds initial support for international markets in the Pipeline API
via addition of the concept of ""domains"".

Significant changes on this branch include:

- Added `zipline.pipeline.domain` and the `Domain` interface.
  - Added several canonical domain definitions:
    - GENERIC
    - US_EQUITIES
    - CA_EQUITIES
    - GB_EQUITIES

- Added `zipline.country` as a place to define canonical country code names.

- Made `PipelineLoader` an interface and added new `domain` parameter to
  signature of `load_adjusted_array`.

- Added a new system for ""generic"" and ""specialized"" DataSet and BoundColumn
  objects.

- Added a new system for inferring a domain from a pipeline that contains a mix
  of generic and non-generic terms.

- Reworked the built-in pricing dataset. USEquityPricing dataset is now a
  specialized version of a generic EquityPricing dataset, and most built-in
  factors are now implemented in terms of EquityPricing rather than
  USEquityPricing.

- Removed `zipline.data.us_equity_pricing`.
  - Moved BcolzDailyBar{Reader,Writer} to `zipline.data.bcolz_daily_bars`.
  - Moved SQLiteAdjustment{Reader,Writer} to `zipline.data.adjustments`.

New dependencies added as part of this work:

- iso3166 (for canonical country code definitions)
- python-interface (for strict interface definitions).

See https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/issues/2265 for a full description of
the design for domains.",0

PERF: Optimize price for liquid assets.

When using `price`, the call to `last_traded_dt` for every value retrieved
became a noticeable bottleneck in algorithms which used over 1000 assets.

Instead of calling `last_traded_dt` before every retrieval of a `close` for the
`price` field, assume that `close` will retrieve a non-empty value, and then
forward fill if it is empty.

The usual formula for covariance is::

   mean((X - mean(X)) * (Y - mean(Y)))

This is equivalent, however, to just doing:

   mean((X - mean(X)) * Y)

Proof:

    Let X_res = (X - mean(X)).
    We have:

    mean(X_res * (Y - mean(Y))) = mean(X_res * (Y - mean(Y)))
                            (1) = mean((X_res * Y) - (X_res * mean(Y)))
                            (2) = mean(X_res * Y) - mean(X_res * mean(Y))
                            (3) = mean(X_res * Y) - mean(X_res) * mean(Y)
                            (4) = mean(X_res * Y) - 0 * mean(Y)
                            (5) = mean(X_res * Y)

The tricky step in the above derivation is step (4). We know that
mean(X_res) is zero because, for any X:

    mean(X - mean(X)) = mean(X) - mean(X) = 0.",0

The core of data/loader.py is the function load_market_data which
in turns calls functions ensure_benchmark_data and

logger.info and logger.exception messages are slightly different
but their logger.warn messages are the same.

Having two different functions outputing the same warning can
be needlessly confusing when debugging.

This fixes a bug with the edge case where:

- A contract (C_0) in the chain has an auto-close date equal to the
  `end` date passed to get_rolls
- The contract following C_O (C_1), is *not* the active contract
  relative to the contract after it (C2), e.g. C_1 has lower volume than
  C_2, etc.

In this case, we need to roll from C_2 back to C_0, in which we would
previously jump to the day following C_0's auto-close date. However, in
this edge case, that would be outside the desired window (past `end`).
Instead, in this case, we'll jump to `end` instead.",0

MAINT: Remove environment as an argument to benchmark source.

To allow the BenchmarkSource class to be more easily used in contexts other than
a TradingAlgorithm, remove the TradingEnvironment as an argument to the
benchmark source.

Instead:
- Pass a benchmark Asset, instead of a bencmark sid; so that the asset_finder
does not need to be passed to the benchmark source.
- Pass the pre-calculated benchmark_returns instead of an env,
which contains the benchmark_returns; a consumer can let the benchmark_returns
stay as the default of `None` when using an asset.

We may want to further refactor and make two different classes, instead of
relying on a combination of existence/non-existence of benchmark_asset and
benchmark_returns. That refactoring should be easier to do with this change.",0

- To work on generic calendars, many tests now use set minutes for

- test_minute_regular should test against active equity minutes
- Adapts test_minute_midnight to work with futures calendar
  - Use a method of getting the last open minute that works with

  - Test against Sunday at midnight, since the real intention of this

Previously, a dataframe passed into BcolzDailyBarWriter.write that was
missing an expected session between its first and last sessions would be
written incorrectly. Upon converting the dataframe to a ctable, the
values for all days following the gap would be shifted backwards, and
nans would be shifted in at the end.

This commit handles the issue by asserting that the number of rows in
the input table matches the number of sessions in the calendar between
the table's first and last sessions.

Also fixes a test that was mistakenly using minutes_in_range where it
should have been using sessions_in_range (uncovered by this change).",0

The CFE was closed along with the NYSE in observation of the days of
mourning in honor of the passing of presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald
Reagan. The CFE also observed the closures due to Hurricane Sandy,
along with NYSE. Adding those adhoc holidays to exchange_calendar_cfe
and removing them from cfe.csv in tests. To fit with
USNationalDaysofMourning, also removing the closure in observation of
the day of mourning in honor of the passing of president Nixon in
1994, despite the fact that the exchange did not exist at that time.

Without this, trying to run a minutely backtest in a test setting only
EQUITY_MINUTE_BAR_LOOKBACK_DAYS and EQUITY_DAILY_BAR_SOURCE_FROM_MINUTE
fails because the benchmark creation process makes a daily history call
for the entire period of the backtest, which then fails because the
equity daily bar calendar is shorter than the equity minute bar
calendar.

From pep-0008:

```
Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a
lambda expression directly to an identifier.

Yes:

def f(x): return 2*x
No:

f = lambda x: 2*x

The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is
specifically 'f' instead of the generic '<lambda>'. This is more useful for
tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment
statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an
explicit def statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression)

Fix multiple errors when attempting to generate rolls for futures which do not
roll month to month, e.g. the Eurodollar.

These errors were caused by logic that always incremented from contract to
contract by delivery month, with errors when the next contract was not part of
the quarterly roll chain and thus had not yet begun trading even though the
previous contract had autoclosed. Instead, filter out these contracts and only
allow contracts that have begun trading before the previous contract's autoclose.

This is in lieu of a more explicit specification of quarterly rolls.",0

Instead of requiring the roll finder to juggle the indices into the ordered

with members pointing to the previous and next contracts in the chain.

Besides improving legibility in the roll finder code, this change is on the path
to adding a predicate to exclude contracts from the chain, e.g. contracts in ED
which are not in the roll schedule.

When the following conditions occur,

- a `nan` occurred after a half day (e.g. on the Monday after
Thanksgiving, where the Friday would be a half day.)

-data was written to the span between the early close and where the market close
would have been if it were not an early close session

- a `nan` also occured on the last minute of the early market session.

the exisitng implementation would incorrectly return a `nan` when requesting a
forward filled price.

The steps that caused this error were.

1. Request for `'price'` on the market open of the day after the early close.

2. `nan` is found for that minute

3. `get_last_traded_dt` is called, and finds a volume that occurs after the
early close. e.g. `18:47` when the market close was `18:00`.

4. The minute position for `18:47` is used, when calling
`find_positon_of_minute`, since that value is after the `market_close` the
minute is set to the position of `18:00`` due to the delta logic in

5. Since there is also no data in at `18:00`, a `nan` is returned, even though
there were valid minutes earlier in the session. e.g. a non-zero volume at
`16:47` should have been used, but was not.

Fix by checking the current minute against the minute close when searching for
the last traded minute. If the minute is greater than the market close for the
corresponding day, continue the search until the minute position is within the
trading session.

This could also be fixed by enforcing that only zeros can be written between an
early close and the minute where the close would have been, but this fix allows
the reader to work with existing data.",0

The end date of the last contract with a sufficient start date was being
used for the continuous future overall end date; however the end date of
that contract (which is the last day for which there is data for the
contract) is not necessarily the greatest end date out of all contracts.
It is possible for the furthest out contract to have some, but very
few, trades before it is more actively traded. Which would give it a
start date within in the range of the simulation, but an end date is
earlier than the other contracts which are active during the simulation.

This bug would result in `nan`s when getting the current price because
of the `end_date` check in `get_spot_value`. When the current simulation
time was greater than the `end_date` of the last contract the condition
which guards against attempting to get data for an instrument past its
end date would return a `nan`, even when the current underlying contract
did have data for that date.

Use max end date of all contracts instead of the last one, to ensure
that the continuous future last date is always great enough to allow
access to all contracts with in the chain.

Also, use min start date to accurately mirror the end date behavior.",0

In preparation for using `DataPortal` in notebooks, remove restriction on
the `HistoryLoader` to dates that are monotonically increasing. Notebook
usage of the `DataPortal` is more useful when the end of the history
window can be arbitrary dates without having to restart the notebook kernel.

Due to the implementation of the prefetch and caching logic, the end
date of history calls could previously only increase. e.g. `2016-11-01`,
`2016-11-02`, `2016-11-03`. This pattern was sufficient for backtesting
and live simulations, since the current time of the algorithm only ever increases.

With this change, which resets the underlying sliding window when the
last fetched idx is greater than the

`2016-11-01`, `2016-10-31`, `2015-11-02` should work.",0

This could be further improved by:

`ContinuousFuture` and `Asset` share a common type (whether that is
`ContinuousFuture` inheriting from `Asset` or making `Asset` and
`ContinuousFuture` share a common type.)

To support using a `DataPortal` and `HistoryLoader` in a notebook, allow
the prefetch length to be configurable, so that it can be set to 0.
Unlike backtesting where the prefetch is useful for repeated history
windows viewed from datetimes which are monotonically increasing by a
small amount, the notebook usage of history windows needs only to
retrieve the exact data needed for the window specified.

Enable unadjusted history for continuous futures.

The history array is filled by the values for the underlying contracts,
where the contract used changes based on rolls.

e.g., if a `1d` history window was over the range
`2016-01-20` -> `2016-02-29` with contracts with a suffix of `F16` that
rolls at the beginning of the session on `2016-01-26`, `G16` on
`2016-02-26`, and `H16` on `2016-03-26`. The `2016-01-20` ->
`2016-01-25` portion would use the values for `F16', the `2016-01-26` ->
`2016-02-25` portion would use `G16` and the `2016-02-26` ->
`2016-02-29` portion would use `H16`.

Using the same contracts as above, a `1m` history window over the range
(using a timezone of US/Eastern) `2016-01-25 4:00PM` -> `2016-01-25
7:00PM` would fill the `4:00PM` -> `6:00PM` portion with data for `F16`
and the `6:01PM` -> `7:00PM` portion with data for `G16`, since the
beginning of the `2016-01-26` session is `2016-01-25 6:01PM`.

Supports `1d` and `1m`.

Also adds the `sid` field to `history` to assist in showing the active
contract at each dt in the window.",0

  and ``timedelta_to_integral_minutes()`` functions and replaces various
  usages of ``int(delta.total_seconds())`` with them.

- Fixes a warnings triggered in ``_create_daily_stats`` from
  passing tz-aware datetimes to np.datetime64.",0

Combine the equity and future readers into asset dispatch readers, so
that simulations that use both asset types can access data for each.

This patch enables `history` for future assets in algorithms; however,
it does not add extra coverage in the `test_data_portal` or `test_history`
to cover future assets. Those tests will follow, however putting this in
separately since it shows that the wrapping of the readers in the asset
dispatch reader does not break existing equity strategies.",0

Add `AssetDispatchSessionBarReader` and corresponding minute and session

This reader routes requests to the appropriate reader based on the asset
type of the requested sids.

`load_raw_array` in the dispatch reader batches the sid by asset type
and then interleaves the results in the out arrays, so that the arrays
data corresponds with sids in the order that sids are passed to the
method, to meet the expected behavior of `load_raw_arrays`.

The dispatch redaer is intended for use by the data portal when using
both future and equities. The dispatch reader will also be passed to the
to the `HistoryLoader`s contained within the data portal, where the
batched `load_raw_arrays` will be used.

Also, BUG:
- Fix the return of `MinuteResampleSessionBarReader.load_raw_arrays` to
match all other readers.
- Use the input dt for the `MinuteResampleSessionBarReader.load_raw_arrays`
as a session label, instead of a minute dt, since it is a session bar
reader.
(Both of these bugs where discovered when using the resample reader for
future data in the dispatch tests.)",0

Adds a new ``downsample`` method to all computable terms.  Computable
terms (Filters, Factors, and Classifiers) can be downsampled to yearly,
quarterly, monthly, or weekly frequency.

The result of ``term.downsample`` is a new term of the same
family (Filter/Factor/Classifier) as ``term``.  The downsampled term
computes by delegating to the original term; repeatedly calling its
``compute`` method with length-1 date ranges.

Downsampled terms take advantage of a new ``compute_extra_rows`` Term
method, which allows terms to dynamically request that additional extra
rows of themselves be computed based on the dates for which they're
being computed.  This ensures, for example, that a monthly-downsampled
term always computes at the start of a month, even when a
naively-calculated pipeline window would end in the middle of the month.",0

- Split out extra_rows handling into an `ExecutionPlan` subclass.
  `ExecutionPlan` now requires the dates and calendar against which a
  set of terms will be computed, and now defers to a term's
  `compute_extra_rows` method when deciding how many extra rows are
  required to compute for that term. This will allow downsampled terms
  to request enough extra rows to guarantee that we can maintain consistent
  calculation dates.

  As a consequence of the above, `TermGraph` now only deals with logical
  dependencies, not with metadata surrounding extra row calculations.
  This means that TermGraph can be used to generate dependency
  visualizations in interactive contexts where we don't yet have a
  calendar or start/end dates.

- Refactored test_{filter,factor,classifier} to use check_terms instead
  of run_graph.  This makes it easier to make changes to TermGraph,
  since the testing interface is now to simply provide a dict of terms.

- Refactored BasePipelineTestCase to use fixtures to create an asset
  finder.  This fixes a potential leak of the test's asset db, which was
  not being explicitly cleaned up.

- Refactored test_technical to use BasePipelineTestCase.

- Added a new special term, `InputDates()`, which can be used to request
  date labels for inputs.  Like `AssetExists`, `InputDates` is provided
  in the initial workspace by default.

- Added a default (failing) `_compute` method to `AssetExists` which
  provides a more useful error than AttributeError.",0

When adding fixtures for futures data, there will be a need for multiple
calendars in the fixture ecosystem. e.g. a test that includes both
equities and futures would need an overall calendar which encompasses
both equities and futures; however, the test data for equities should
still still be limited to the bounds set by the NYSE calendar.

Make the fixtures that setup trading calendars and values dervied from
the trading calendar (e.g. trading sessions) accept an iterable of
calendars which need to be created, then populate those values into a
dict keyed by the calendar name.

Change `WithNYSETradingDays` to include sessions in the name,
since we are moving to session as the name for the 'day' unit.

Provide `trading_days` which is really ""NYSE trading sessions` on
`WithTradingSessions` for backwards compatibility.",0

Previously, on the dt of a capital change, we use the un-updated
prices to find the ending performance of the previous subperiod and
then got the new prices to determine the portfolio value used to
calculate the delta, without actually updating the performance
before applying the capital change. This logic is confusing and
unintuitive. Instead, save the ending performance as we do previously,
but have temp values for the starting current subperiod value.
Update those temp values after processing the capital change",0

- Added test coverage for grouped and masked top/bottom.

- Added test coverage for grouped rank on datetime factors.

- Fixed an issue where grouped rank would fail on datetime inputs
  because unary-negative isn't defined for datetimes.  We now instead
  directly invoke a function from rank.pyx that does the normalizations
  as neeeded.

- Fixed an issue where GroupedRowTransform assumed that it produced the
  same dtype as its input.  This isn't true for rank() of a
  datetime-dtype factor.  GroupedRowTransform now takes a required dtype
  parameter.

- Similarly, fixed an issue where GroupedRowTransform assumed that its
  missing_value was the same as its parent's, which isn't true for
  rank() of a datetime-dtype factor.  GroupedRowTransform now takes a
  required dtype parameter.

- Fixed an issue where Factor.demean() and Factor.zscore() weren't
  properly cached because their static_identity included a closure that
  was dynamically generated on each invocation.  They both now always
  use a function defined at module scope.",0

- Revert to using DateOffset, as Timedelta doesn't handle offsetting by

    Out[13]: Timestamp('2004-04-04 00:00:00-0600', tz='America/Chicago')

  By creating a DateOffset using the `days` kwarg, the issue previously
  fixed in bcc867b is addressed.

  performing these with no timezone, then localizing to the local
  timezone when shifting the time.

Andrew Daniels,https://api.github.com/repos/quantopian/zipline/commits/dd38ca97474461145202c6ece254736f01ac671e/comments,2016-06-21 14:14:19,,Andrew Daniels,2016-06-21 14:31:35,"BUG: Removes Hurricane Sandy closings from CME exchange calendar

Since the CME calendar was based off of the NYSE calendar, closings for
Hurricane Sandy were included, but shouldn't have been for CME.

This is the explanation we had included prior to the new exchange
calendars:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_sandy

We *do not* add any non-trading days for Hurricane Sandy. Although
trading on CME Group exchanges was disrupted, trading still occurred at
some point on each day. Importantly, the disruptions do not appear to
have affected the expiration dates stipulated in the futures contracts
expiring during this period.

Trading of CME US equity index futures & NYMEX futures was disrupted due
to the hurricane's impact on New York. CME US equity index futures
markets were disrupted on October 29th 2012, but reopened at 5:00pm CT.

The US equity index markets were closed from 8:15am CT on October 30,
both for the trading floor and CME Globex. The trading floor of the
NYMEX was closed on October 30, but all floor-trading products were
available electronically on CME Globex.

Fix behavior in minute mode history with frequency `1d`, where on the
day immediately following an adjustment action, the overnight adjustment
would not apply. (However the adjustment would be applied after a 1 day
lag.)

The root cause of the bug was that the history data for minute mode when
using `1d` stitches together a sliding window of the daily data for
previous  and the current minute. That daily data sliding window and
corresponding adjustments was being read as if the data was being viewed
from on the last day of the window; however in this case the data is
being viewed from the day after the window has completed. The difference
in view points requires the adjustments to popped and applied by the
adjusted array one index earlier. The fix uses the `extra_slot` value as
signifier on whether the data is being viewed on the following day and
then accordingly adjusts the index of the mulitpy object.

Also, change the split and merger test data ratios to have different values,
to ensure that different adjustment values are applied; as opposed to
doubling up on just one of the values.",0

We need to call gc.collect before tearing down our class because we have
a cycle between TradingAlgorithm and AlgorithmSimulator which ultimately
holds a reference to the pipeline engine passed to the tests here.

This means that we're not guaranteed to have deleted our disk-backed
resource readers (e.g. SQLiteAdjustmentReader) before trying to delete
the tempdir, which causes failures on Windows because Windows doesn't
allow you to delete a file if someone still has an open handle to that
file.

The real fix for this is to break the cycle between TradingAlgorithm and
AlgorithmSimulator, but that requires significant breaking API changes.",0

- Return a value from `verify_all_indices_unique` so that `panel` isn't

- Fix a bug where we always set the volume of every asset to `1e9`.

- Add minimal suite of tests for get_spot_value, which catch both of the

NOTE: There are still several issues with `PanelDailyBarReader`.  The
docstring for `get_spot_value` claims that it will return -1 on days
where an asset didn't trade, which isn't the case.  It also claims that
it will raise `NoDataOnDate` when a request is made outside the panel

for `load_raw_arrays`, so it's likely that there are more bugs lurking.",0

- Adds a new class, ``LabelArray``, which is a subclass of np.ndarray.
  LabelArray is conceptually similar to pandas.Categorical, in that it
  stores data with many duplicate values as indices into an array of
  unique values.  For string data with many duplicates (e.g. time-series
  of tickers or or industry classifications), this provides multiple
  orders of magnitude of improvement when doing string operations,
  especially string comparison/matching operations.

- Adds a new generic object ""specialization"" for `AdjustedArrayWindow`,
  and a corresponding ObjectOverwrite adjustment.

- Adds a new ``postprocess`` method to ``zipline.pipeline.term.Term``.
  This method is called on the final result of any pipeline expression
  after screen filtering has occurred. The default implementation of
  ``postprocess`` is identity, but Classifier overrides it to coerce
  string columns into pandas.Categoricals before presenting them to the
  user.",0

Tested with the size 1000, on an algo that was using pipeline which was
using over 3000, runtimes were similar, but the memory usage was
successfully capped to around 1.2GB.

Also, tested with an algorithm which bought and hold just one equity and
no major slow down was seen when using the LRUCache vs. a dictionary.

We may want to follow this up with an extension to `carray` which is not

Adds the data bundle concept which makes it easy for users to register
loading functions to build out minute and daily data along with an
assets db and adjustments db. By default we have provided a `quandl`
bundle which pulls from the public domain WIKI dataset. Users may
register new bundles by decorating an ingest function with
`zipline.data.bundles.register(<name>)`. This also provides a
`yahoo_equities` function for creating an ingestion function that will
load a static set of assets from yahoo.

The cli is now structured as a couple of subcommands and has been
changed to `python -m zipline`. The old behavior of `run_algo.py` has
been moved to the `run` subcommand. This is almost entirely the same
except that it now takes the name of the data bundle to use, defaulting
to `quandl`.

The next subcommand is `ingest` which takes the name of
a data bundle to ingest. This will run the loading machinery and write
the data to a specified location that `run` can find.

There is also a `clean` subcommand which deletes the data that was
written with `ingest`.

Extensions have also been added to zipline. This is an experimental
feature where users can provide an extra set of python files to run at
the start of the process. These can be used to configure aspects of
zipline. Right now the only thing that is supported in an extension file
is the registration of a new data bundle.",0

The BcolzDailyBarReader was optimized for the pipeline case of reading
all assets at once.

Now that the reader is also used to support daily history the case of
reading a data for a small number of assets is more common, particularly
in algorithms that use the history API which have a high rotation of
assets (e.g. an algorithm which pipeline uses to set the active
universe)

Remove the bottleneck in reading a small number of assets by
conditionally reading the slice for each asset from the carray, instead
of reading the data for all equities and then indexing into that full
array. On a certain number of assets, it is still better to read all the
data at once. On the Quantopian dataset, which holds data for 20000
about for the last 10 years of equity data (where not all equities trade
over the full range), stored in 118 blosc blp files per column, the
tipping point where the 'read all' mode wins out between 3000-4000
assets.

That number was tested by trying to exercise a worst case scenario where
the equities were spread out evenly across the blp files, by stepping
along a sorted list of assets that were alive over a query range which
spanned 70 trading days.
```
size = 3000
sids = [assets[i] for i in range(0, len(assets), len(assets) /
size)][:size]
```

Also, add parameter to WithBcolzDailyBarReader fixture which allows the
test to specify what the threshold count for reading all data should be,
so that the test_us_equity_pricing can be forced into either mode to
make sure that both branches in logic are covered by all test cases.

On local dev machine this patch improves the read time of `load_raw_array`
for one asset from 100 ms to 96.5 µs. (10^5 improvement.) With reading
only asset per call a being an observed common case when populating the
non-cached values in USEquityHistoryLoader.",0

Changes BcolzDailyBarWriter to not be an abc, data is passed as an
iterator of (sid, dataframe) pairs to the write method.

Changes the AssetsDBWriter to be a single class which accepts an engine
at construction time and has a `write` method for writing dataframes for
the various tables. We no longer support writing the various other data
types, callers should coerce their data into a dataframe themselves. See
zipline.assets.synthetic for some helpers to do this.

Adds many new fixtures and updates some existing fixtures to use the new
ones:

WithDefaultDateBounds
  A fixture that provides the suite a START_DATE and END_DATE. This is
  meant to make it easy for other fixtures to synchronize their date
  ranges without depending on eachother in strange ways. For example,
  WithBcolzMinuteBarReader and WithBcolzDailyBarReader by default should
  both have data for the same dates, so they may use depend on
  WithDefaultDates without forcing a dependency between them.

WithTmpDir, WithInstanceTmpDir
  Provides the suite or individual test case a temporary directory.

WithBcolzDailyBarReader
  Provides the suite a BcolzDailyBarReader which reads from bcolz data
  written to a temporary directory. The data will be read from
  dataframes and then converted to bcolz files with
  BcolzDailyBarWriter.write

WithBcolzDailyBarReaderFromCSVs
  Provides the suite a BcolzDailyBarReader which reads from bcolz data
  written to a temporary directory. The data will be read from a
  collection of CSV files and then converted into the bcolz data through
  BcolzDailyBarWriter.write_csvs

WithBcolzMinuteBarReader
  Provides the suite a BcolzMinuteBarReader which reads from bcolz data
  written to a temporary directory. The data will be read from
  dataframes and then converted to bcolz files with
  BcolzMinuteBarWriter.write

WithAdjustmentReader
  Provides the suite a SQLiteAdjustmentReader which reads from an in
  memory sqlite database. The data will be read from dataframes and then
  converted into sqlite with SQLiteAdjustmentWriter.write

WithDataPortal
  Provides each test case a DataPortal object with data from temporary
  resources.",0

Fix a bug where if history were called with assets `[1, 2]` and then
subsequently, `[2, 1]`, the loader would return the cached array in
order for `[1, 2]`.

Instead cache an AdjustedArray for each asset, then when a history
window is requested, check if each asset has a sufficient cache, and if
not then read values for the assets which are missing or need to be
refreshed.

An added benefit of this change is that if a subsequent call to history
has a smaller number of assets than the previous, no new data needs to
be read from disk. e.g. a call with assets `[1, 2, 3]` and then `[1, 2]`
would use the cached values for `1` and `2` from the first call.

Conversely, if the second call has more assets, then only the data for
the new assets needs to be retrieved. e.g. a history with `[1, 2]`, then
`[1, 2, 3]` would only need (assuming `1` and `2` have not expired) to
retrieve data for `3`. Unfortunately, the benefit here is not great
because `load_raw_arrays` is optimized for reading many assets, and
pulls the entire daily bar dataset into memory. This change makes tuning
`load_raw_arrays` so that faster reads (e.g. by slicing from the carray
for each asset, instead of pulling all data into a numpy array), when
only a few assets are requested, more beneficial than it would have been
previously.",0

To follow is splitting the cache up by column and by sid, so that the
loader does not re-prefetch sids which have already been read with
sufficient data; however this patch is enough to fix the issue where an
algo with high rotation can add up a megabyte per day of memory on
algorithms which rotate on a 5% dollar volume pipeline. With this cap
those algorithms have more plateaus with regard to memory consumption.

Instead of using the `remember_last` memoization on all calls to
`_find_position_of_minute`, add an instance local cache which is only
used by the `get_value` call. The `get_value` call is very hot, so any
extra overhead (e.g. creating the WeakArgs on every invocation) becomes
costly. The current usage `get_value` also has the property that it is
called with monotonically increasing, but with a high repeat count on
each value. (A further improvement could making a `get_value` which
supports being used by many sids, for use by the update portfolio
positions.)

The caching is not done at the `_find_position_of_minute_level` because
`unadjusted_window` always uses two positions on the tape (start and end
of range) which would cause the entries and removal into the cache which
would be invalidated both between the calls of start and end, and next

When the dts and length of cols are mismatched the writer behaves in
unintended ways. e.g. in a case where a consumer passed dts which had
minutes with no trades removed, but regular (market minute for day)
sized arrays for the data with `0`'s on minutes without trades, the non
trade minutes from cols are written to slots in the output where a trade
is intended.

Protect against this misuse by checking that all lengths are equal when
using the `write_cols` method.

Make a separate `_write_cols` method for use by both `write_cols` and
`write`, since the `write` method which takes a DataFrame has the
matched input length enforced by the DataFrame.",0

Classifiers are computations that represent grouping keys. They can be
used in conjuction with normalization functions like ``zscore`` or
``demean`` to perform normalizations over subsets of a dataset.

Notable changes:

- Added ``demean()`` and ``zscore()`` methods to ``Factor``.

- Added a classifier versions of ``Latest`` and ``CustomTermMixin``.
  The .latest attribute of int64 dataset columns no produces a
  classifier by default.

- Added ``Everything``, a classifier that maps all data to the same
  value.

- Added ``zipline.lib.normalize``, which implements a naive, pure-Python
  grouped normalize function.  This will likely be moved to Cython in a
  subsequent PR.",0

Previously, we have assumed that the `amounts` and `last_sale_prices`
lists have the same order as the `value_multipliers`. This is not
correct, since to populate the `amounts` and `last_sale_prices` lists
we iterate over a `dict` (self.positions). The order of this `dict`
can change in arbitrary ways when it is updated, which occurs when
we call `update_positions`. Our `value_multipliers` however are stored
in an `OrderedDict`, meaning the order of existing key/value pairs
is not changed when they are updated.

To address this issue, we make sure that `self.positions` subclasses
`OrderedDict`.",0

Fix a bug where creating a sid bcolz file when the containing directory
was already occupied by a sid caused an OSError on attempt of creating
the directory because it already existed.

e.g. if there were two sids, `1` and `2`. The paths would be
`00/00/000001.bcolz` and `00/00/000002.bcolz` which share the same
directory `00/00`.

Fixed by checking for directory existence before calling `makedirs`.

the sid directory structure.",0

Implement a writer for minute data into a format comprised of multiple
ctables, one for each individual asset, with a common 'index' shared by
all ctables where a given a dt maps to the same array index for all
equities and fields.

This format is pulled from the lazy-mainline/Q2.0 branch, with some
changes to the interface.

Add basic retrieval of values at a given dt to reader. Not yet used by
Zipline simulations, but added to support unit tests.

Also, rename stubbed out us_equity_minutes to minute_bars, since the
writer can be agnostic to asset type.",0

In preparation for the incoming changes which no longer push every bar
through the tradesimulation, remove the adjustment of the period's cash on
every pricing change of a held futures asset.

Instead hold the last sale price for each held future either:

- At the end of each peformance period update the last sale prices of
  all held futures, so that the pnl for the next period uses values
  derived from the cash difference between the end of the two periods.

- When a transaction is processed for the Future, so that the correct
  amount is applied to each cash adjustment. (i.e. the cash adjustment
  is reset on every change of amount of the Future being held, so that
  multiple size and prices do not need to be tracked for the same asset.)

Also, remove now unused dict of payout calculation modifier, since new
calculation reads the value directly off of the asset.

Remove update_last_sale test, since the method no longer returns a cash
value.",0

Moved from the `lazy-mainline` branch,
https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/pull/858

The intent of this patch to provide the basic class and readers
interfaces, developed on that branch, so that the use of creating the
object and opening paths etc. can be tested internally.

Additional changes beyond the lazy-mainline branch, addition of future
minute reader, and daily bar reader.

Also allow an argument of the future_daily_reader, though no such reader
yet exists.

It may be that future and equity readers share an interface, and a
further improvement would be providing an abstract base class.

EarningsCalendar loader.

- Moves most of AdjustedArray back into Python. The window iterator is
  the only part that's performance-intensive.

- Adds a bootleg templating system for creating specialized versions of
  AdjustedArrayWindow for each concrete type we care about.

- Adds support for differently dtyped terms in pipeline. This allows us
  to use datetime64s which are needed in the EarningsCalendar.

- Adds EarningsCalendar dataset for the next and previous earnings
  announcements in pipeline.

- Adds in memory loader for EarningsCalendar.

- Adds blaze loader for EarningsCalendar.",0

Adds tests asserting that we resolve conflicts in accordance with the
following rules when we have multiple assets holding the same symbol at
the same time:

If multiple SIDs exist for symbol S at time T, return the candidate
SID whose start_date is highest. (200 cases)

If multiple SIDs exist for symbol S at time T, the best candidate
SIDs share the highest start_date, return the SID with the highest
end_date. (34 cases)

It is the opinion of the author (ssanderson) that we should consider
this malformed input and fail here.  But this is the current indended
behavior of the code, and I accidentally broke it while refactoring.

Our DataFrame index resolution logic relies on failed lookups **not**

hit when repeatedly looking up sids.  The ""solution"" here is to clear
the caches after writing in new assets.

The real fix for this is either:

1. Don't construct an AssetFinder until we have the datasource in hand
   in run(), or
2. Don't symbol-map the user's input source if it's a DataFrame.
   Instead we should make our data loaders pre-map the data.",0

Replaces our custom XML parsing with a single call to `pd.read_csv`
against the federal reserve's API.  This produces nearly identical
results as compared to the old loader, but it's dramatically simpler and
roughly 10x faster on my machine.

The average difference in magnitude between new and old is approximately
10e-7, and only one entry is different to a degree greater than the
number of significant figures provided by treasury.gov.

Additionally, the new loader correctly ignores Columbus Day of 2010, for
which the old loader erroneously produced an all-NaN row.

This also changes the interface that treasury modules modules are
required to implement. Modules must now supply a `get_treasury_data`
function that returns a `DataFrame` with a daily `DatetimeIndex` and a
column for each supported treasury duration.

Detailed comparison between results from new and old loader::

    from zipline.data.treasuries import get_treasury_data
    new = get_treasury_data() # New implementation
    old = pd.read_csv(  # Previously cached data
        '/home/ssanderson/.zipline/data/treasury_curves.csv'
        parse_dates=[0],

For a pipeline doing simple computations on USEquityPricing data, we
were spending ~60% of `run_pipeline` loading adjustments.  Almost all of
that time was spent in calls to `DatetimeIndex.get_loc` to find the
indices of adjustment `eff_date`s.

This optimizes the eff_date lookups by pre-populating a cache of
seconds-since-epoch timestamps that we expect to see, and falling back
to `np.searchsorted` on cache misses.

In testing, this reduces the time to compute a 1-year pipeline with 30
and 90 day moving averages from 3.1 seconds to 0.9 seconds.",0

This commit moves input string capitalization exclusively to the API

capitalized by a preprocess API method decorator. The preprocess
decorator passes the input string to the newly defined
ensure_upper_case() method, which returns a TypeError if the argument
supplied is not a string.

ensure_upper_case() is defined in a new file, zipline/utils/input_validation.py.
The existing expect_types() method is also moved there.

Instead of calculating the position values for each stat result, e.g.
gross_exposure, net_liquidity etc.; get the positions upfront and then
calculate the period and position stats in order, passing each value
explicitly to the ones that follow it in the dependency chain.

e.g. the gross_value depends on the long_value and the short_value,
which called the position_values property for calculating both the
long_value and the short_value.

Removing the repeated calls to position_values (and
position_exposures) removes the need for the caching the last sale
prices and position amounts in separate vectors, since it is inexpensive
enough to read those values off of the positions dictionary held in the
position tracker.

This patch gives a small gain to ~500 sized portfolios, but the main
intent is to clear the path to not storing last_sale_prices on the
position objects at all. Removing all of the caching layer in this class
makes that change easier to apply. Removing the extra calls to
position_values also made this class easier to step through/reason about
when splicing in the new last sale price access, as well.",0

- Fixes an error where Modeling API data known as of the close of `day
  N` would be shown to algorithms during `before_trading_start` as of
  the close of the same day.  Algorithms should now only receive data
  during `before_trading_start/handle_data` that was known as of the
  simulation time at which the function would be called.

- All Term instances now have a `mask` attribute that must be a `Filter`
  or an instance of `AssetExists()`.  `mask` can be used to specify that
  a Factor should be computed in a manner that ignores the values that
  were not `True` in the mask.

- Changed the interface for `FFCLoader.load_adjusted_array` and
  `Term._compute` from `(columns, mask)`, with mask as a DataFrame, to
  `(columns, dates, assets, mask)`, where mask is a numpy array.  This
  is primarily to avoid having to reconstruct extra DataFrames when
  using masks produced by non `AssetExists` filters.

- Adds `BoundColumn.latest`, which gives the most-recently-known value
  of a column.",0

- Add an `ascending=True` keyword to `rank()`.

  originally thought the fast path was 2-3x faster because I had my
  benchmark data axes flipped.  The actual speedup is only 5-10%, which
  means it probably wasn't worth the effort to Cythonize...but we have a
  slightly faster version now so we might as well use it.

- Refactor test_filter and test_factor to make it easier to implement
  and test transformations on factors.  These tests now subclass
  BaseFFCTestCase, which provides facilities for passing a dict of terms
  and an ""initial_workspace"", the values for which are used by

This patch lays the groundwork for a compute engine designed to
facilitate construction of factor-based universe screening and portfolio
allocation.  It contains:

A new module, `zipline.modelling`, containing entities that can be used
to express computations as dependency graphs.  Each node in such a graph
is an instance of the base `Term` class, defined in
`zipline.modelling.term`.  Dependency graphs are executed by instances
of `FFCEngine`, defined in `zipline.modelling.engine`.

A new module, `zipline.data.ffc`, containing loaders and dataset
definitions for inputs to the modelling API.

New `TradingAlgorithm` api methods: `add_factor`, and `add_filter`.
These methods can only be called from `initialize`, and are used to
inform the algorithm that each day it should compute the given terms.
Computed factor results are made available through a new attribute of
the `data` object in `before_trading_start` and `handle_data`.  Computed
filter results control which assets are available in the factor matrix
on each day.",0

Attack the startup bottleneck of creating the asset finders caches for a
large universe, which was between 1-2 seconds on development and
production machines.

Instead, allow the AssetFinder to be passed a sqlite3 file that has
already been populated and then hydrate asset objects only when an
equity is referenced for the first time.

To create aforementioned sqlite3, create an AssetFinder with an db_path
and `create_table` set to True. If `create_table` is set to False, the
prepopulated data in the sqlite file found at db_path will be used.

Default behavior is to use an in memory database.

Behavior that changes:

- Fuzzy lookup now only works on one character, that character needs to be
specified at write/metadata consumption time, since the fuzzy lookup key
is created by dropping the character from each symbol.

- Overwriting partially written metadata is no longer
  supported. i.e. some unit tests allowed for inserting just the identifier,
  and then later updating the symbol, end_date, etc.

  Instead of building an upsert behavior at this time, this patch
  changes the unit tests so that the data for each asset is only
  inserted once.

Other notes:

- populate_cache is now removed, since there is no longer a two step
  process of inserting metadata and then realizing that metadata into
  assets. _spawn_asset is rolled into insert_metadata, so that a call to
  insert_metadata both converts the metadata and makes it available in
  the data store.",0

By having both the trade simulation main loop route events to ""process""
methods based on event type and the process methods also checking event
type, there was some duplicated effort in doing that comparison many
times.

A particular case where this was noted in profiling was for the
`process_event` function which was checking if the type was not a trade
and returning early, when in a larger universe of stocks the value
returned False 99% of the time.

Instead provide separate process functions specific to each type,
e.g. e.g. `process_trade` and `process_transaction` and route traffic to
those functions in tradesimulation.

For a universe of 160 stocks on both no-op algo and an algo that rebuys
its universe every day, saw about a 10% increase locally.

Also:

- Add process_benchmark to blotter since internal subclass relies on
logic on benchmark, this allows the internal process_trade to be a
`pass`.

- Add warning on unrecoginzed event types.",0

Limited use of `pandas` data structures in both `HistoryContainer` and
`RollingPanel`. Where possible, methods were amended to return raw
`ndarrays` with the indexing logic done separately. This allows us to
cut down the number of times pandas objects are created both as returns
and intermediate values. The separation of indexing from data access
allowed us to minimize the times we’d make use of pandas indexes.

This required that that certain methods like `NDFrame.ffill` be replaced
with versions that work with `ndarrays`. Some of this was done via
straight numpy methods and others by access pandas internal
machinery. Outside of allowing us to use faster ndarrays, many of these
function provided speedups over their pandas counterparts as we didn’t
require the extra features like handling multiple dtypes. i.e. np.isnan
is faster than pd.isnull, but only works with certain dtypes.",0

Instead of checking the positions indexes every time either
`_position_amounts` or `_position_last_sale_prices` is updated, check
and grow the individual Series on each update.

This gain with this patch is by reducing the following bottlenecks:
- Checking both vectors when only one is updated.
- Using try/except to trigger the growth, instead of incurring the cost
of checking the Index contains on every update.

In testing this change results in about a 33% speedup of the
`update_last_sale` algorithm when run with a buy and hold algorithm with

Previously, all specs had to be pre-allocated by using the 'add_history'

the HistoryContainer to pre-allocate the space for the given spec.

History can grow by increasing the length for a frequency, adding a
frequency, or adding a field. It can grow with any combination of
these.

HistoryContainer now is aware of the data_frequency of the algorithm,
and no longer uses the daily_at_midnight flag; instead, this is the

Overhaul the core HistoryContainer logic to be more robust to changing
universes.

Major Changes
-------------
* Remove `return_frame` cache.  The original purpose of using
  return_frames was to avoid having to create new DataFrames on each
  iteration of handle_data, but we ended up having to copy the return
  frames anyway because user code could mutate the frames in place.
  Removing the return_frames reduces unnecessary copying, and reduces
  the logic of `get_history` to just forward-filling and concatenating
  two DataFrames.

* Use a `MultiIndex`ed DataFrame to represent
  `last_known_prior_values`.  This makes lookups faster and greatly
  simplifies the logic of adding and dropping sids.

* HistoryContainer no longer attempts to determine its universe based on
  the contents of its internal buffers.  The TradingAlgorithm
  controlling the container is now responsible for explicitly calling
  `add_sids` or `drop_sids` when securities enter or leave the
  algorithm's universe.  These methods, along with the internal
  `_realign` method, provide a clean interface for changing the universe
  of securities managed by the container.

* Refactor index mutation logic in `RollingPanel` into a
  `MutableIndexRollingPanel` subclass.  Maintenance of the old behavior
  is regrettably necessary to support `BatchTransform`.

* Refactor shared logic from `roll` and `get_history` into a single
  `aggregate_ohlcv_panel` method that's responsible for collapsing an
  OHLCV buffer into a frame.",4

Previously the last sale price was not correctly being set on

in one holding stocks that were bough >>0 and now had value 0 from
the perspective of returns. The returns would display correctly again
when the next trade of that security happened. For most securities trading is
frequent enough that there's no issue, but for some illiquid ones it took
hours to fix itself.

allowing the sharpe ratio to be calculated. The sharpe ratio can no longer
be calculated for this specific tested scenario and the test has been changed

There were sevaral places you could supply sim_params
in TradingAlgorithm (__init__, run). This got confusing
as its not clear who updated what and which one was the
correct one to use at each time.

Then there were to ways to define data_frequency, one in
__init__() and one in the sim_params which also added code
complexity.

This refactor makes it explicit that sim_params are to be
passed to __init__() only. Moreover, data_frequency is
only stored in sim_params. For backwards compatibility,
it can still be supplied separately but will link to
the one in sim_params.

For example, you could create new sim params via:

sim_params = create_simulation_parameters(data_frequency='minute')
algo = MyAlgo(sim_params)
algo.run(data)

In addition, perf_tracker only gets initialized in one place:
_create_generator() which should also make the various ways
of running an algorithm more deterministic.

This also fixes a bug with SimulationParameters where
you could not change the period_start. Unfortunately, the
current implementation still requieres an implicit call to
update the internal variables.",0

The bug occurred because there is a special case in the initial window setup
code for handling the case where only a length-1 history is used for a given
frequency.  Previously, the code was incorrectly calculating the period end
using a hard-coded expression for the end of the day (the correct behavior for
a length-1 '1d' history), and then using the frequency object to calculate the
period start for the window.  In the case of length 1 '1m' data, this resulted
in an initial window whose start and end was the last minute of the day rather
than the first minute of the day.  For non-price fields, this error doesn't
matter, because the window is only used for rolling digests (which doesn't
happen when there's only a length-1 history), and for the forward-filling logic
(which only happens on price fields).  For a length-1 '1m' price, however, the
incorrect window causes us to attempt to forward-fill an empty panel, resulting
in an IndexError when we do an iloc[0] on a length-0 axis.",0

Overhauls `HistoryContainer` in prep for support of more than one frequency.

Major changes:

   - Methods/variables referring to ""day"" have been renamed/generalized.
     - `current_day_panel` became `buffer_panel`, which is now a `RollingPanel`
     - `prior_day_panel` became a dictionary mapping `Frequency` objects to
       ""digest panels"", which are instances of `RollingPanel`.

   - Hard-coded daily rollover replaced with a notion of a ""current window"" for
     each unique frequency managed by the panel.

     - When the end of the current window is reached for a given frequency, we
       compute an aggregate bar (code refers to this as a ""digest""), which is
       appended to a panel associated with that frequency.

     - Window rollover dates are managed by a pair of dictionaries,
       `cur_window_starts` and `cur_window_closes`.  The `Frequency` class is
       responsible for computing window bounds based on the open/close of the
       previous window.

   - Semantic change to the `open_price` field: `open_price` now always
     contains the price of the first trade occurring in the given window.
     Previously it contained the price of the first minute in the window,
     returning NaN it the security happened not to trade in the first minute.",0

Make the portfolio property on TradingAlgorithm call `updated_portfolio`
internally.  This prevents needless recomputation of the portfolio between
calls to `handle_data`, and also prevents issues where the portfolio object
could be unexpectedly modified in place in the body of a `handle_data` call.

Noteworthy finding in the course of investigating this bug:

If you modify a Python dictionary while iterating over it, the language will
only throw an exception if the size of the dictionary changes between loop
iterations; this means that you can do:
```
x = {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}
for k in x:
    old_val = x[k]
    del x[k]
    x[f(k)] = old_val

and you'll only get an error if f(k) is already a key in the dictionary.
This can lead to bizarre/nondeterministic behavior in the key iterator.",0

* Explanation of how risk calculations are changing

** Risk Fixes for Both Period and Cumulative

*** Downside Risk

   Use sample instead of population for standard deviation.

   Add a rounding factor, so that if the two values are close for a given
   dt, that they do not count as a downside value, which would throw off
   the denominator of the standard deviation of the downside diffs.

*** Standard Deviation Type

    Across the board the standard deviation has been standardized to using
    a 'sample' calculation, whereas before cumulative risk was monstly using
    'population'. Using `ddof=1` with `np.std` calculates as if the values
    are a sample.

** Cumulative Risk Fixes

*** Beta

   Use the daily algorithm returns and benchmarks instead of annualized
   mean returns.

*** Volatility

   Use sample instead of population with standard deviation.

   The volatility is an input to other calculations so this change affects
   Sharpe and Information ratio calculations.

*** Information Ratio

   The benchmark returns input is changed from annualized benchmark returns
   to the annualized mean returns.

*** Alpha

   The benchmark returns input is changed from annualized benchmark returns
   to the annualized mean returns.

** Period Risk Fixes

*** Sortino

    Use the downside risk of the daily return vs. the mean algorithm returns
    for the minimum acceptable return instead of the treasury return.

    The above required adding the calculation of the mean algorithm returns
    for period risk.

    Also, use algorithm_period_returns and tresaury_period_return as the
    cumulative Sortino does, instead of using algorithm returns for both
    inputs into the Sortino calculation.

* Other Supporting Changes

** answer_key

   Add new mappings for downside risk and Sortino as well as
   re-address the index mappings because of changes to the answer key
   spread sheet.

** test_risk_cumulative

   Change the decimal precision to expect higher precision.
   The calculations are now more aligned with the answer key, so we can
   expect higher precision. In particular now that the standard deviation
   type matches everywhere in both the Python implementation and the answer
   sheet, the precision of the first value no longer has to be glossed over.

** test_events_through_risk

  Change the results which are used as a canary for risk changes,
  since we do expect Sharpe to change with this change..",0

Uses a method called 'record' that provides a key value,

The variables are stored internally to the algorithm in a dictionary,
and not just stared as a property of the algorithm.

Main intent behind this change is to make the API more user friendly,
since the previous recorded_variables relies on the value to be set
in the algorithms context/self, the hope is that only having to use
the `record` method means less moving pieces and a more understandable
API.

i.e., instead of:

```
def initialize(self):
    recorded_variables('foo', bar')

def handle_data(self, data):
    self.foo = 1
    self.bar = 2

The API is now:

```
def initialize(self):

It's possible to avoid the collapse via by adding the `how='all'` flag
to `dropna`, however with the current tick based creation of the panel,
the `dropna` with `how='all'` should be functionally equivalent to
not dropping at all.

The dropna has been dropped in favor of leaving the drop to algorithm

environment.

Parameters are passed into an algorithm as a keyword argument, sim_params.
SimulationParameters creates a trading day index for the test period that

global state.

Algorithm returns and the risk calculations that depend on them now include
cash dividends. This commit does _not_ provide an API for user algorithms to
access dividends.

PerformanceTracker expects the dividend data to arrive as events, similar to
the way that Trades arrive. Dividends are expected to have adjusted payment
amounts that are inline with adjusted trades.

PerformanceTracker maintains state of all the unpaid dividends in the position
objects held in PerformancePeriod. Dividend objects contain all the relevant
dates (declared, ex, payment) as well as net and gross amounts. Dividends are
removed from the list as they are paid. Cash flow is not incremented until the
payment day. This creates the possibility of a dividend being owed but not
paid or realized before the end of a test. For example, a dividend with an
ex_date of today may have a pay date 2 weeks in the future. Right now the
algorithm does not receive any credit for unpaid dividends.

Tests cover buying/selling around the ex_date and payment_date, and checking
that the performance calculated is as expected.",0

I wrote this a little while ago as I noticed that a lot of time is spent
computing risk statistics. This is done over the complete history over
and over again while this could be done just by using the previously
computed value (iteratively).

We didn't go forward back then because for minute trade data the
difference was not significant enough. However, now with zipline
standalone I think most people will use daily (because that's
what's available) and it makes a huge difference
(speed-up of a couple of 100%).

Unfortunately, we can't just replace the existing one with an
iterative as for the final cumulative stats the batch is still
better. So that's not as nice, but the performance increase is
big enough for me to issue this PR (zipline is actually painfully
slow with daily data).

There is a unittest that compares that both produce exactly
the same outputs.

Speed measurements (for 500 trading days, daily source):

This prevents blocking in the next() method of a component. But it requires generators wrapping the component to handle None.

Also modified component's receiver creation to be triggered on the first call to next, rather than iter.
This change means that the zmq context and socket for the component's receiver should always be created in
the same process as the consumer of the generator. Chaining together component wrapped generators will
result in the send process of the last component actually instantiating the receive socket of the prior component.
In this way, the components are actually communicating directly via zmq.

Component's send method now calls the wait_ready(), which waits for the monitor's GO message, inside
the generator loop. This guarantees that the generator's next method is called before the send loop blocks
on the monitor. As a result, components will call __init__ and next() without blocking, mimicking the
behavior of plain generators.",0
